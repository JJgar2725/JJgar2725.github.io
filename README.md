Online Portfolio - Jaime Garcia, Jr.

A simple portfolio that I created using a brief tutorial online and a premade template.
This small project contributed to my learning and practice in Git and Github, as well as to solidify some basic concepts in HTML and CSS.
I intend to create a more custom website from scratch in the future.
If you have any questions, or would like to contact me, my contact information
is on the following link. Thank you!
